 ## Description 
  Welcome to the newest iteration of RecipEZ! This project is currently in the planning/architecture stages and is not currently usable. Once an MVP (minimum viable product) is available we will update this page.

 ## Contribution Guidelines

 Contributors are welcome, just keep a few things in mind:

1. All contributions are to be made in a separate branch off develop or in an independent fork. Do not attempt to contribute to develop or main directly, it will be denied.

2. All contributions are subject to peer review, so please keep your code clean and readable, feel free to comment as much as you like, however most of those comments will likely be removed from the source code and added to the official documentation in the final version if your contributions are merged. Your code should speak for itself wherever possible. 

3. This project will be using a semantic versioning system, so when making commits be sure to use structured commit messages. 
Example: 
```
git commit -m "2.0.0-feature.0" -m "description of changes goes here" -m "footer goes here if youd like to include one"
```
<br/>
The general idea is always make the header of your commit message the version number of the code base your branch is based off of, followed by the name of the name feature that branch is dedicated to and the commit number/version number of that feature. 
<br/>
This allows everyone to follow the history of all modifications very easily in the event we have to hunt down a bug or roll something back to a previous version for any reason. 
<br/>
The major version numbers of Main and Develop will be handled by authorized repository managers and follow the semantic versioning conventions. 
<br/>
Since this will be a 100% rebuild of the original RecipEZ we are starting at 2.0.0, once we reach an MVP we will release 2.1.0 and move up from there. 
<br/>
Semantic Versioning Overview:
```
major version number
          |
          2.0.0
            | |____Patches, BugFix, and minor updates
            |
      Minor version number
      (feature add ins)
```

Credit for major features and patches will be annotated in the version release notes.
